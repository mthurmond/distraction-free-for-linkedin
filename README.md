# Distraction free for Linkedin™
## Overview
[Install the chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/distraction-free-linkedin/kigfnbfbpfpgphbocdkmeablbgdbpfke) so you can use LinkedIn™ in a calmer, more intentional way. 
 
The extension removes distractions from LinkedIn™. This is a chrome browser extension so only works if you're using the LinkedIn™ site in chrome. 

See a problem? Please [file any issues here](https://github.com/mthurmond/distraction-free-for-linkedin/issues). 

This extension is not affiliated with or produced by LinkedIn™. I've gotten a lot of value from using LinkedIn™ in the past, and hopes that this extension will help you use it even more effectively.
